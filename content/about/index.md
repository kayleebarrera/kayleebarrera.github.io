I have a broad interest in exoplanets, with a focus on studying young planets to better understand planetary evolution and planet demographics. My current work involves cross-validating Gaussian process models of stellar activity using radial velocity measurements. I am also enthusiastic about exploring other exoplanet detection and characterization techniques, as well as learning about the development of more precise instrumentation.

Beyond research at MIT, I serve as President of the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science (EAPS) Undergraduate Council, where I have been fostering our growing undergrad community and contributing to the improvement of the undergraduate curriculum. I also hold a position as Co-President of [MIT's chapter of Undergraduate Women in Physics](https://sites.mit.edu/uwip/) to support gender minorities in physics and help promote civic engagement on campus through [MITvote](https://mitvote.mit.edu/).

I am a proud Jersey girl born to Mexican immigrants and a first-generation college student. In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy novels and hanging out with my family cats. In high school, I majored in Digital Media & Arts—though I’ve since taken a different path, I still enjoy writing silly reviews on Letterboxd and talking about Christopher Nolan movies.
